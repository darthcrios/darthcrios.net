      <h2>Rejection Protocol</h2>
      <p class="date">May 8, 2025</p>
      <p>The apartment buzzed with fluorescent fatigue. A single LED blinked on the interface beside his laptop, keeping rhythm with the ticking of the kitchen clock. Críos, as he called himself in private—sat slouched in a cracked office chair, headphones pressing lines into his temples. He hadn’t moved in hours.</p><p>The synth patch was nearly perfect. Swirling, analog, cold but alive. It wrapped around the vocal he’d recorded weeks earlier, a strange, distant whisper that warned, “They only fear what they can’t package.”</p><p>This wasn’t for a client. Not tonight.<p>For nearly a decade, had been a ghost. He’d sculpted the sonic skeletons of radio hits, bolstered careers he couldn’t publicly claim, all for labels that demanded silence in the contract fine print. His name—erased. His ideas—credited to others. His creativity—sold like raw material.</p><p>But this time was different. This was his.</p><p>He uploaded the demo under a new name: CRÍOS—all caps. He embedded his signature in the metadata, encrypted and even inserted a phrase backwards in the outro, like a code only the true listener could hear.</p><p>Two weeks passed. Then, an email:</p><p>"We’ve heard your track. Come in." - Polaris Music Group</p><p>Polaris. The monolith. The tastemakers. They shaped the very air of the mainstream. This could be it.</p><p>The office was glass, plastic, and smiles. A tall man in a thin suit leaned back, hands steepled. “You’ve got some talent, I’ll give you that,” he said. “But this track—what is it, ‘Hearts Beyond Firewalls’?—it’s dense. Weird time signature, lyrics in… Gaelic?”</p><p>“Irish,” Críos corrected, barely audible.</p><p>“Right,” the exec said, dismissive. “Look, we’re not sure what to <i>do</i> with this. It’s got... energy, but it’s not <i>marketable.</i> Nobody wants cryptic synth poetry. They want something they can play while scrolling TikTok.”</p><p>Críos kept still. His heartbeat felt like a 4/4 kick drum</p><p>“We’ll tell you what we can do,” the exec said, flipping a folder across the table. “We have a new pop duo debuting next quarter. We want you to ghostwrite their debut EP. Think Calvin Harris meets Doja Cat. You’re good at that sort of thing.”</p><p>Críos stared at the folder. On the cover: a holographic logo and a blank space where an artist name would be penciled in later.</p><p>“I’m not interested,” he said.</p><p>The executive's smile faded slightly. “Let’s be clear. You’re still under NDA for all your prior work with us. If you release any solo material, especially anything derived from those projects, we’ll bury you in legal.”</p><p>There it was.</p><p>Control. Ownership. Silence</p><p>Críos stood, left the folder on the desk, and walked out without another word.</p><p>....</p><p>The train ride home was static.</p><p>He didn’t sleep that night. Instead, he backed up his drives, pulled cables, stripped metadata from files, encrypted his passwords, and wiped every trace of himself from the music industry’s servers. Then he started building the new system. His own system.</p><p>He soldered an old audio interface to a Raspberry Pi and built a patch that would convert MIDI signals into encoded broadcast pulses. He filtered his voice through an old vocoder and wrote manifestos in the noise floor of his own tracks.</p><p>He created a new name: Darth Críos</p><p>A villain to their world, a beacon to the others. Not an artist—they rejected that. Not a ghost—they owned that. Something else. Something unbuyable.</p><p>Weeks later, the first track dropped: Isolated Red</p><p>No artist credited. Just a signal. Just a frequency. Within hours, it spread across message boards, torrent sites, USBs handed out at underground clubs. Hidden within the chorus was a phrase that only played if the tempo was slowed to 82.4 BPM:</p><p>“Reject the signal. Become the sound.”</p><p>The cult began quietly.</p><p>Someone spray-painted the phrase outside a closed-down venue in Berlin. Someone else played the track on a pirate FM station in South London. A teenager in Tokyo decoded a spectrogram message hidden in the hi-hats: GPS coordinates to an abandoned satellite dish.</p><p>A myth was born.</p><p>And deep in a gray apartment, just before sunrise, Darth Críos smiled for the first time in years.</p></div>
