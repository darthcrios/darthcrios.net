    <h2>The Pull Begins</h2>
    <p class="date">May 14, 2025</p>

    <p>Los Angeles smelled like burnt ozone and blooming night jasmine — a city forever caught between fire and perfume. The Santa Ana winds dragged smoke from distant wildfires across the hills, wrapping the skyline in a rust-colored haze. Down on Sunset, the billboards glowed through the smog like digital saints, their faces flickering in silent benediction.</p>

    <p>Críos walked among them, guitar case in hand, his boots crunching over glass and fallen palm bark. He’d only been in L.A. six months, but every night the city seemed to listen to him — like the concrete held its breath when he tuned his guitar.</p>

    <p>Back home in Co. Meath, they thought he’d come chasing dreams — record deals, big lights, maybe a scandal or two. They didn’t know he hadn’t come for anything. He’d come because of something. Something he couldn’t name.</p>

    <p>Críos held his new busking license in one hand and his Gibson SG in the other. The paper was creased from being folded too many times, but it still felt like a ticket to something bigger. He had told everyone back home this was his start — “playin’ the boardwalk, makin’ a name.” That was the story they believed.</p>

    <p>The truth was simpler and stranger: he just couldn’t stop feeling this pull.</p>

    <p>Every evening at sunset, he set up near the railings overlooking the water. Plugged into a small portable amp. A foot pedal for looping. A hat for change. The ocean breeze would cool his fingers as he played slow blues riffs — the kind that should’ve felt warm and alive.</p>

    <p>But, something is off.</p>

    <p>The first time, the amp simply cut out mid-song. No hiss, no pop — just silence. Críos checked the cables, the battery pack, the connections — all fine. He brought it home later, plugged it in, and it worked perfectly.</p>

    <p>The second time, a crowd had gathered. A few tourists, a skater, a woman with her dog. He started playing Little Wing,letting the notes drift like sea mist — and as he bent a high note, the air shifted. The dog began to whine. The crowd went still. And Críos — for the first time — heard something that wasn’t music.</p>

    <p>A voice. A thought.</p>

    <p>“That sounds like Dad’s guitar… before he left…” “I shouldn’t have come here. I need to go…”</p>

    <p>Their faces hadn’t changed, but something behind their eyes did — like they were remembering and confessing all at once. He froze, hands hovering over the strings. The air around the amp felt charged, as if a thunderstorm had slipped between him and the ocean.</p>

    <p>When he stopped playing, the whispers stopped too. The crowd blinked, shuffled, tossed a few dollars in his case, and walked off like nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>Críos packed up sat there for a long time, the sunset bleeding red across the pier. His guitar hummed faintly, even though it wasn’t plugged in.</p>

    <p>The next night, he returned to the boardwalk, guitar slung over his shoulder, the ocean wind teasing at his hair. The amp hissed to life as he plugged in, and as he strummed the opening chord, a familiar tingle crawled up his spine. He had felt it before — the subtle hum that wasn’t sound, but presence.</p>

    <p>As he played, the crowd thickened, drawn in by the rhythm, the groove of blues bending into rock. Most of them were just enjoying the music, he assumed, laughing, swaying, tossing coins into the case. But Críos noticed small anomalies. A woman’s gaze lingered too long on his hands, not in admiration but in awe, almost fear. A teenager fidgeting with his skateboard suddenly froze mid-trick, staring at him as if seeing something invisible.</p>

    <p>He didn’t notice at first, too focused on the riffs flowing from his fingers. But then came the first whisper — not from the amp, not from the wind, but from inside his own head:</p>

    <p>“I should have called her back.”</p>

    <p>He stopped, mid-strum. The words weren’t his. He looked around. The crowd hadn’t moved, yet something about the air had changed — a tension, a weight. Then, faintly, another thought:</p>

    <p>“I never told anyone… I miss him.”</p>

    <p>He shook his head, blaming it on exhaustion or city stress. And yet, he felt it again — that subtle, resonant pull whenever he bent a note just right.</p>

    <p>Over the next few nights, patterns emerged. When he “hit the zone,” when the music truly took over, he could hear fragments: desires, regrets, confessions — small shards of other people’s lives. And sometimes, those people seemed to awaken to it themselves: a glance filled with understanding, a tear, a sudden inspiration to act on a buried memory. Not everyone — just a scattering, enough to unsettle him.</p>

    <p>He remained blissfully unaware of the bigger picture. He thought he was just lucky, or particularly talented that day.</p>

    <p>But in the shadows, hidden in alleys, above rooftops, and behind the reflections of neon signs, something watched. Something ancient. Something patient. It waited to see what he would do, and whether the gift — or curse — would grow strong enough to call it fully into the world.</p>

    <p>Because music was the bridge. And Críos, whether he knew it or not, had just begun crossing.</p>

    <p>The days grew warmer, the sunlight spilling across Santa Monica like liquid gold. Críos switched to busking in the mornings / afternoon, when the pier teemed with tourists and sunburnt families. Somehow, the strange whispers and flashes of insight faded in daylight, leaving only the music and the occasional appreciative nod.</p>

    <p>It was a relief.</p>

    <p>But nightfall brought a restlessness he couldn’t shake. The pier emptied, neon lights flickered on, and the city seemed to stretch itself thin, shadows slipping into alleyways like smoke. Críos wandered the streets of Los Angeles with his guitar case over his shoulder, eyes scanning the brick facades of bars and clubs. He’d been practicing, networking, but nothing clicked yet. He needed a stage, a crowd beyond the boardwalk, something that would make him seen.</p>

    <p>As he passed the neon sign of a dive bar tucked into a narrow street in Silver Lake, memories of home rose unbidden. In Co. Meath, he had a knack for this: charming his way onto any lineup, persuading grumpy bar owners to let his band play, spinning stories about crowds that didn’t yet exist. He could make a room believe in him before he even played a note.</p>

    <p>He smiled to himself, recalling one particular night when a pub owner, arms crossed and scowl fixed, had muttered, “You’ve got five minutes, lad — don’t bleedin waste ‘em,” only to have his band leave the place begging for an encore. That kind of silver tongue and unshakable confidence had gotten him everywhere back home.</p>

    <p>Here, in Los Angeles, it felt different — bigger, stranger, and slightly dangerous. But the instinct remained. He slipped inside the dive bar, introducing himself to the manager with a disarming grin, weaving a few stories of past gigs and small crowds that had turned into waves of applause. It worked — as it always did. A couple of nights later, he had secured not just one, but two gigs in nearby cities: Echo Park and Long Beach.</p>

    <p>Walking home after the arrangements were made, the city’s neon glow reflected off the wet asphalt, and the wind carried a faint hum, almost imperceptible, like a note lingering just beyond hearing. Críos shrugged it off, blaming the coastal breeze. Yet, as he drifted down the quiet streets, a shadow followed from just beyond the reach of the streetlights, keeping pace without moving. Something watched him. Always.</p>

    <p>And somewhere deep in the city, music waited to answer</p>

    <p>The bar was packed that night, dimly lit and smelling faintly of spilled beer and pumpkin spice — the kind of tacky-but-charming décor only late October could justify. Críos set up his amp and pedals on the small stage, a few orange candles flickering at the edge, casting tall, trembling shadows on the walls.</p>

    <p>He started playing, slow and deliberate, the opening chords of a blues riff rolling out like mist. The crowd cheered, half-drunk and ready to be entertained, and Críos felt the familiar pull — that subtle hum beneath the music, like something listening just beyond perception.</p>

    <p>1/2 way through his set is usually when he decides to play some originals</p>

    <p>And thats when it happened.</p>

    <p>The lights flickered once. Twice. And then everything went black.</p>

    <p>For a heartbeat, the crowd gasped — then laughter.</p>

    <p>“Oooooooooo” someone yelled. “It’s all part of the show huh” another shouted.</p>

    <p>Críos froze. The hum beneath the music swelled, vibrating through his chest. He could see — somehow — every shadow in the room stretch and twist, as if reaching toward him. The amp still worked. The guitar still sang, glowing faintly in the dark like a living thing. And yet… it wasn’t just the lights.</p>

    <p>He realized he could hear them — not the audience as a whole, but each person individually, their thoughts weaving through the darkness. A man near the bar thinking about debts he’d never pay. A woman in the corner regretting a life choice she’d never confessed. A teenager imagining secrets about friends and lovers he wouldn’t say out loud.</p>

    <p>And then something new — something not human?, not one of the crowd — moved in the periphery. A shadow coalescing near the ceiling, bending the faint candlelight around it. It was watching him. Waiting.</p>

    <p>Críos’ hands shook as he strummed another chord. The shadows pulsed with the rhythm, drawing closer. The audience didn’t notice. To them, it was part of the act — the ultimate Halloween spectacle. But Críos could feel it in his bones: this wasn’t a trick. Something had taken interest.</p>

    <p>He stumbled backward, heart hammering, and the hum in the air became almost a voice, whispering through the strings:</p>

    <p>“Play…go on. Play…I want to hear your music.”</p>

    <p>The lights flickered back on just as abruptly as they had gone out. The crowd erupted in applause, hooting and cheering, oblivious to the danger that had almost reached him.</p>

    <p>Críos looked down at his guitar, sweat cold on his neck. The music had called something forth. Something was watching. And now, he couldn’t pretend that the pull was just luck, talent, or coincidence anymore.</p>

    <p>The next few gigs were… normal. Too normal. Críos played small bars in Echo Park and Long Beach, each performance smooth, the amps working perfectly, the audience enjoying themselves without incident. No strange whispers. No shadows stretching unnaturally in the corners. It was almost disappointing — almost comforting. He even laughed to himself on the drive back from the last show, thinking maybe the first bar incident had just been a Halloween trick of his imagination.</p>

    <p>After packing up at this Silver Lake dive bar, he leaned against the bar counter, watching the next act take the stage. The spotlight bounced off polished wood and bottles, but he wasn’t looking at the performers — he was counting the minutes, thinking about how quickly the night had passed.</p>

    <p>The bar manager approached, wiping her hands on a towel. “So Sarah,… do you think you could set me up for another gig here?”</p>

    <p>Críos smiled, leaning in slightly, exuding the same charm that had gotten him into countless lineups back in Ireland. “ I can do weekends, evenings — whatever you need.”</p>

    <p>She shook her head, polite but firm. “Not here. Our schedule’s full for the month. But… you might want to check out our sister bar in DTLA. They’re looking for a DJ for Halloween weekend.”</p>

    <p>Críos’ eyes lit up. “A DJ? Really?”</p>

    <p>She shrugged, tossing him a wry smile. “Yeah. They don’t want just anyone. Is that your thing? I have a feeling you could charm them into letting you try. Just don’t blow it.”</p>

    <p>By the time he got home, he had already drafted a plan. He would call the club the next morning, charm his way onto their roster, and secure a spot. Within hours, it was done. Críos had a gig — Halloween weekend — in the heart of Downtown LA, surrounded by neon lights and the promise of chaos.</p>

    <p>Then reality hit him. He had thirteen days. Thirteen days to learn how to DJ. Thirteen days to mix, scratch, and curate a playlist that would keep hundreds of partygoers entranced, terrified, and dancing.</p>

    <p>The following days flew by in a blur of practice and experimentation. Críos found himself laughing more than he had in weeks, headphones on, mixer knobs under his fingers, exploring loops and beats in the Tech House style everyone seemed to be enjoying.</p>

    <p>He had even taken to calling himself Darth Críos — a tongue-in-cheek alter ego for the DJ world. There was a thrill in adopting a persona, giving the music a character, and somehow the name felt right, darker than he realized. He started building his own tracks, layering deep basslines with eerie synths, hints of blues guitar tucked into loops — a subtle signature only he would notice.</p>

    <p>By the weekend, he had two original tracks ready for the Halloween gig. He loaded them onto the deck, doing a quick sound check. The place smelled of candy corn, spilled beer, and anticipation. Costumes fluttered in the low lights, and the stage reflected a neon orange glow, perfect for Halloween.</p>

    <p>The gig kicked off smoothly. Críos started with some classics — Thriller by Michael Jackson, a remix of The Monster Mash — and the crowd loved it, dancing and cheering. He grinned, feeling the rhythm, the lights, the energy of hundreds of people moving together.</p>

    <p>Then came the moment he had been waiting for: his own track.</p>

    <p>He dropped the first beat. A low, throbbing bass filled the room. The synths rose, teasing something eerie and hypnotic. And then it hit.</p>

    <p>That familiar, tingling hum returned — the same one he had felt during his first bar gig, back at Silver Lake. Only now he realized it wasn’t random. It was coming from him, from the music he was creating.</p>

    <p>A shiver ran down his spine. He kept playing, trying to act normal, but the pull was undeniable. He glanced at the crowd. Faces were locked onto him, mesmerized, not just by the music but by something else. Thoughts began to creep into his mind, fragments he shouldn’t be able to hear</p>

    <p>They came in waves, scattered and disjointed — laughter, curiosity, flashes of nostalgia. Most were harmless, fleeting things: a woman wondering if she’d left her oven on, a man thinking about his ex who used to love Halloween, a group debating where to find tacos after the show.</p>

    <p>But then, cutting through the noise like a shard of glass, came something darker.</p>

    <p>“…she won’t laugh at me again.”</p>

    <p>The words hit him so clearly it almost made him miss his cue. Críos blinked, fingers trembling over the mixer. He kept the beat running, forcing himself to stay composed, but the voice came again, louder this time, seething.</p>

    <p>“…she thinks she can embarrass me in front of everyone. Not tonight.”</p>

    <p>His gaze swept over the crowd — masked faces, flickering lights, smoke machines curling like restless spirits. The music thumped through the floor, through his chest, through them. He couldn’t pinpoint where the thought was coming from, but the rage behind it burned like static.</p>

    <p>He transitioned to the next track, trying to keep the energy up while reaching inward, tuning that strange frequency only he seemed to feel. The more he focused, the clearer the thoughts became — until he could sense the emotion, the direction, almost a pulse inside the crowd itself.</p>

    <p>Then he saw him.</p>

    <p>A man near the back, standing unnaturally still amid the movement. Everyone else danced, laughed, shouted — but not him. He just stared toward the bar, toward a woman laughing with her friends. His expression was hollow, almost detached, but Críos could feel the turmoil radiating from him like heat.</p>

    <p>“…wait until she’s alone.”</p>

    <p>Críos’ stomach twisted. He nearly stopped the music right there, but instinct told him not to. The last thing he needed was a scene — or to lose the thread. He kept playing, acting like nothing was wrong, eyes flicking between the mixer and the man in the crowd.</p>

    <p>The rest of the set blurred. Applause, cheers, lights. But all Críos could hear was that single thought echoing in his skull, long after the final track faded out.</p>

    <p>When the set ended, he packed up quickly, thanked the manager, and slipped out a side door into the cool Los Angeles night. The air smelled of smoke and cheap perfume, the sound of distant sirens carried on the wind.</p>

    <p>The man from the crowd was there, walking fast down the street, hood up. Críos hesitated — every rational thought told him to let it go, to forget it, to chalk it up to stress or imagination.</p>

    <p>But something stronger pushed him forward. That same pull.</p>

    <p>He followed.</p>

    <p>Through alleys slick with fog and streetlight, through the hum of late-night traffic and the throb of bass leaking from other bars. The man’s pace quickened, his movements erratic. Críos stayed back, his heartbeat syncing with each echoing step, unsure if he was the hunter or the hunted.</p>

    <p>And then — the man turned sharply into a dead-end alley.</p>

    <p>Críos slowed, his breath misting in the cold. There was no one else around. The hum of the city faded until all he could hear was his own pulse.</p>

    <p>Then, from the darkness, the voice again — but this time it wasn’t in his head.</p>

    <p>“You shouldn’t have followed me.”</p>

    <p>The man turned, the alley’s dim orange glow from a nearby streetlight catching his mask — a skull, grinning wide and cracked, like something from a half-forgotten nightmare. For a second, Críos thought of Donnie Darko, of shadows that whispered in riddles, of fate wearing a costume.</p>

    <p>Then the man spoke.</p>

    <p>“You shouldn’t have followed me.”</p>

    <p>His voice was flat, calm, too calm. Críos froze, realizing how deep they were in — the alley was boxed in by chain-link fences and dumpsters, and the streetlights didn’t quite reach this far. He opened his mouth to talk, to diffuse, but the man stepped forward.</p>

    <p>“Look, mate,” Críos started, holding up his hands. “Didn’t mean to bother you. Just thought you looked like you needed —”</p>

    <p>“Like I was what?” the man snapped. “Crazy?”</p>

    <p>His tone cracked, shifting from cold to volatile. He pulled the mask off, revealing bloodshot eyes, sweat, and a face twisted by anger and something else — fear, maybe.</p>

    <p>“You think you can just follow people around, huh?” the man hissed, stepping closer. “You think you know me?”</p>

    <p>Críos’ pulse thudded. “No, I just—listen, you were at my gig, right? I saw you out there—”</p>

    <p>“Yeah, I saw you too,” the man spat, closing the gap between them. “Up there, thinking you’re somebody. You think your music means something.”</p>

    <p>There was movement — quick, jerky — and Críos saw the glint of metal in the man’s hand.</p>

    <p>He staggered back, heart racing. “Hey—hey, calm down. I don’t want trouble.”</p>

    <p>The man smirked, shifting the blade in his grip. “Then why follow me?”</p>

    <p>Before Críos could answer, blue and red light flooded the alley.</p>

    <p>The sharp echo of a police siren sliced through the tension, washing the brick walls in color. Both men froze, the sudden authority of it breaking whatever madness had been building.</p>

    <p>“Hey!” one of the officers shouted, stepping out of the squad car with a flashlight. “You two, stay right there!”</p>

    <p>The man in the skeleton mask hesitated — just long enough for Críos to think he might surrender. Then, as the officers approached, he darted into the darkness at the far end of the alley, slipping through a gap between the fences. Gone.</p>

    <p>“Jesus,” Críos muttered, exhaling for what felt like the first time in minutes.</p>

    <p>The officers jogged over, flashlights sweeping the area. “You all right?” one asked. “You look pale.”</p>

    <p>“Yeah,” Críos said, rubbing the back of his neck. “Just—some guy from my show. I think he was messed up.”</p>

    <p>The second officer eyed the guitar case still slung over his back. “You a musician?”</p>

    <p>“DJ, kind of,” Críos said, forcing a small laugh. “Halloween gig.”</p>

    <p>“Right. Well, looks like he’s gone. Stay in the lit streets, yeah?”</p>

    <p>Críos nodded. “Yeah. Absolutely.”</p>

    <p>The officers gave him a quick pat on the shoulder — that mix of reassurance and dismissal — before heading back toward their cruiser. Críos turned, pulling his jacket tighter as he walked away from the scene. The neon hum of the city swallowed the moment, and for a second, it almost felt over.</p>

    <p>Almost.</p>

    <p>Behind him, the faint chatter of the officers carried through the night air — something about calling it in, getting a patrol to sweep the area. He didn’t listen too closely. His heartbeat was still a drum in his ears, and all he wanted was to get home, close the door, and forget that alley ever existed.</p>

    <p>His boots hit the cracked pavement in rhythm, steady, trying to ground himself in the ordinary sound of his own steps. He rounded the corner, passing the glow of a broken streetlight, when a chill ran through him — sudden and sharp, like invisible ice water pouring down his spine.</p>

    <p>He froze. The air around him seemed to thicken, heavy and electric. The city noise dulled, as if the world were holding its breath.</p>

    <p>He didn’t know why — but something was wrong.</p>

    <p>A whisper of wind rolled through the street, carrying the faintest metallic scent. It shouldn’t have been noticeable in a city that smelled of oil and salt and cigarettes, but Críos knew that smell. It was the scent of blood.</p>

    <p>Goosebumps prickled across his arms. He looked back toward the alley, where blue and red light still pulsed faintly against the brick walls. He couldn’t see the officers, but he heard movement — one of them calling out, then a pause. A silence too long to be normal.</p>

    <p>Then a voice — distant, tight, trying not to shout. “Jesus Christ… over here!”</p>

    <p>Críos’ breath hitched.</p>

    <p>He couldn’t see what they’d found, but something deep in his chest told him it had to do with that man. The one in the skeleton mask. The one whose thoughts had dripped with hate and violence.</p>

    <p>He didn’t want to know. Didn’t want to believe it. He forced his feet to keep moving.</p>

    <p>By the time he reached the main road, the sirens were back — louder this time, closing in. He slipped into the flow of pedestrians, head down, heart pounding, pretending he didn’t feel the invisible static still crawling beneath his skin.</p>

    <p>But even as he reached his apartment, locking the door behind him, that strange coldness lingered — a residue in the air, humming faintly like a note caught in feedback.</p>

    <p>Críos leaned against the wall, eyes closed, guitar case still in hand. He could still hear it. That low vibration. That quiet hum. It was faint, distant — but it wasn’t fading.</p>

    <p>The morning light over Los Angeles was too bright. It cut through the blinds in sharp stripes, painting across Críos’ small apartment like prison bars. The TV flickered in the corner, volume low, steam rising from a mug of untouched coffee beside him.</p>

    <p>“—police are investigating what they’re calling a possible ritualistic homicide that occurred late last night in an alleyway off Sunset and North Alvarado…”</p>

    <p>Críos’ stomach sank.</p>

    <p>The anchor’s tone was detached, professional, but the words hit him like a slow punch. The screen showed flashing lights, yellow tape, and the outline of a white sheet. The camera panned — briefly, almost carelessly — over a cracked plastic mask.</p>

    <p>A skull.</p>

    <p>His skull.</p>

    <p>The one from the alley.</p>

    <p>He muted the sound, staring in silence. The voice of the reporter faded, but the words still rang in his head: ritualistic killing.</p>

    <p>He wasn’t sure what that meant — or why the term sent a cold pulse through him. He tried to laugh it off. “Ritualistic.” The guy had probably overdosed or gotten into another fight. The press just loved a good headline, especially this time of year.</p>

    <p>Still… the air in his apartment felt off. Stale. Humming with that faint vibration he’d been feeling since last night, as though some invisible amp was running somewhere in the walls.</p>

    <p>He shook his head, setting the remote down. “Enough of that.”</p>

    <p>He stood, stretching, trying to shake the tension from his shoulders. His small studio setup was in the corner — his Reface YC keyboard glowing faintly beside the laptop, his Gibson resting on its stand. The sight steadied him. Music always did.</p>

    <p>He decided it would be a chill day. No gigs, no wandering, no weirdness. Just music.</p>

    <p>Críos plugged in the Reface, letting his fingers drift over the keys. A mellow synth patch. A touch of chorus. Something to drown out the static. The first few notes came easy, smooth, and for the first time since the alley, he felt the world slow down again.</p>

    <p>He layered in a simple kick — house tempo, heartbeat steady. Then a guitar riff, bluesy and haunted, looping over the rhythm. The sound grew warm, textured, alive.</p>

    <p>But somewhere underneath, buried deep in the mix, he thought he heard something else.</p>

    <p>A whisper.</p>

    <p>So faint he almost missed it.</p>

    <p>He muted the track, listening. Nothing. Just the hum of the city outside.</p>

    <p>Críos exhaled, half laughing at himself. “You’re losing it, man.”</p>

    <p>He saved the session file, naming it Skeleton Groove — a dark joke, just to make light of it. But when he clicked save, his reflection in the laptop screen caught his eye.</p>

    <p>For a split second — no more than a blink — he thought he saw someone standing behind him.</p>

    <p>A shape. Faint. Watching.</p>

    <p>Then it was gone.</p>
