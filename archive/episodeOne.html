    <h2>The Pull of the City</h2>
    <p class="date">May 14, 2025</p>

    <p>Los Angeles smelled like burnt ozone and blooming night jasmine — a city forever caught between fire and perfume. The Santa Ana winds dragged smoke from distant wildfires across the hills, wrapping the skyline in a rust-colored haze. Down on Sunset, the billboards glowed through the smog like digital saints, their faces flickering in silent benediction.</p>

    <p>Críos walked among them, guitar case in hand, his boots crunching over glass and fallen palm bark. He’d only been in L.A. six months, but every night the city seemed to listen to him — like the concrete held its breath when he tuned his guitar.</p>

    <p>Back home in Co. Meath, they thought he’d come chasing dreams — record deals, big lights, maybe a scandal or two. They didn’t know he hadn’t come for anything. He’d come because of something. Something he couldn’t name.</p>

    <p>Críos held his new busking license in one hand and his Gibson SG in the other. The paper was creased from being folded too many times, but it still felt like a ticket to something bigger. He had told everyone back home this was his start — “playin’ the boardwalk, makin’ a name.” That was the story they believed.</p>

    <p>The truth was simpler and stranger: he just couldn’t stop feeling this pull.</p>

    <p>Every evening at sunset, he set up near the railings overlooking the water. Plugged into a small portable amp. A foot pedal for looping. A hat for change. The ocean breeze would cool his fingers as he played slow blues riffs — the kind that should’ve felt warm and alive.</p>

    <p>But something was off.</p>

    <p>The first time, the amp simply cut out mid-song. No hiss, no pop — just silence. Críos checked the cables, the battery pack, the connections — all fine. He brought it home later, plugged it in, and it worked perfectly.</p>

    <p>The second time, a crowd had gathered. A few tourists, a skater, a woman with her dog. He started playing <i>Little Wing</i>, letting the notes drift like sea mist — and as he bent a high note, the air shifted. The dog began to whine. The crowd went still. And Críos — for the first time — heard something that wasn’t music.</p>

    <p>A voice. A thought.</p>

    <p><i>“That sounds like Dad’s guitar… before he left…”</i></p>
    <p><i>“I shouldn’t have come here. I need to go…”</i></p>

    <p>Their faces hadn’t changed, but something behind their eyes did — like they were remembering and confessing all at once. He froze, hands hovering over the strings. The air around the amp felt charged, as if a thunderstorm had slipped between him and the ocean.</p>

    <p>When he stopped playing, the whispers stopped too. The crowd blinked, shuffled, tossed a few dollars in his case, and walked off like nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>Críos packed up and sat there for a long time, the sunset bleeding red across the pier. His guitar hummed faintly, even though it wasn’t plugged in.</p>

    <p>• • •</p>

    <p>The next night, he returned to the boardwalk. The amp hissed to life as he plugged in, and as he strummed the opening chord, a familiar tingle crawled up his spine. Blues bent into rock, looping through the air. The crowd thickened.</p>

    <p>Most people just enjoyed the music. But a woman stared at his hands with something like fear. A teenager froze mid-trick. And then the first whisper hit — not through the amp, but inside his skull.</p>

    <p><i>“I should have called her back.”</i></p>

    <p>He stopped mid-strum. Not his thought.</p>

    <p><i>“I never told anyone… I miss him.”</i></p>

    <p>He blamed exhaustion. Stress. L.A. weirdness. But the pattern continued night after night. When he hit the zone, he could hear fragments — regrets, secrets, memories — and sometimes they echoed back into the people who owned them. A tear. A realization. A spark.</p>

    <p>In the shadows, something watched. Something ancient, patient. Waiting to see how far the gift — or curse — would go.</p>

    <p>Because music was the bridge. And Críos had started crossing.</p>

    <p>• • •</p>

    <p>Days warmed. The whispers faded in daylight. He busked through the morning rush, the boardwalk full of tourists and sunburnt families. Normal felt good.</p>

    <p>But night brought restlessness.</p>

    <p>He wandered the streets of Los Angeles, playing small bars and clubs, charming managers the way he had back home. Echo Park said yes. Long Beach said yes. Silver Lake too.</p>

    <p>But something always followed — a shadow just beyond the streetlights. Watching.</p>

    <p>• • •</p>

    <p>The night of the Silver Lake gig, the bar smelled like spilled beer and cheap October candles. He played slow blues, the crowd swaying.</p>

    <p>Halfway through the set, the lights flickered. Once. Twice. Then — darkness.</p>

    <p>The crowd laughed, thinking it was part of the show. But Críos felt the hum rise — that same pull. Every shadow in the bar stretched toward him. And in the dark, he heard their thoughts. All of them. Hundreds of minds overlapping like discordant chords.</p>

    <p>And then something else. Not human. Watching from the ceiling.</p>

    <p>The lights snapped back. The crowd cheered. Críos shook.</p>

    <p>• • •</p>

    <p>The following gigs were normal. Too normal.</p>

    <p>After one show, Críos asked the manager if she could book him again. She shook her head, but mentioned their sister bar in DTLA needed a DJ for Halloween weekend.</p>

    <p>Within hours, he had the gig. Thirteen days to learn DJing.</p>

    <p>He practiced relentlessly. Built tracks. Adopted the name <b>Darth Críos</b> as a tongue-in-cheek persona. Dark. Playful. A reflection of something deeper.</p>

    <p>Two original tracks were ready by Halloween. The gig was electric — costumes, lights, candy-corn-sweet beer. He dropped his first track. The bass throbbed. Synths rose.</p>

    <p>And the hum returned.</p>

    <p>Thoughts flooded him again. But one stood out — sharp, violent:</p>

    <p><i>“…she won’t laugh at me again.”</i></p>

    <p>He found the man. Still. Watching. Thinking dark things.</p>

    <p>He followed him after the show.</p>

    <p>Down alleys.</p>

    <p>Into a dead end.</p>

    <p>The man turned. Mask cracked like a nightmare skull.</p>

    <p>Metal glinted.</p>

    <p>Then sirens — flooding the alley in blue and red. The man fled through a gap in the fence.</p>

    <p>The officers ensured Críos was safe. “Stay in the light,” one warned.</p>

    <p>He walked away — shaken.</p>

    <p>But something felt wrong.</p>

    <p>A scent in the air. Metallic. Cold. He heard an officer shout:</p>

    <p><i>“Jesus Christ… over here!”</i></p>

    <p>He didn’t look.</p>

    <p>Sirens screamed as he walked home. Something was humming beneath his skin. Something wouldn’t let go.</p>

    <p>• • •</p>

    <p>Morning light cut harsh stripes across his apartment. On TV:</p>

    <p><i>“Police are investigating what they’re calling a possible ritualistic homicide…”</i></p>

    <p>The screen flashed a cracked skull mask.</p>

    <p>He muted the TV.</p>

    <p>He decided to make music — to calm the static inside him. He played synths, layered guitars, built a haunted house groove.</p>

    <p>He saved the file as <b>Skeleton Groove</b>.</p>

    <p>And in the laptop reflection, for just a blink — he thought he saw someone standing behind him.</p>
