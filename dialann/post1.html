                <p>Originally I started doing this in Irish only. However I have decided to expand into English. Mostly just to get better with the coding aspect. I picked up a couple of books from the Yorba Linda Library, and you may have noticed some new additions such as the <a href="https://www.darthcrios.net/vlog.html" style="color:yellow;">Vlog.</a>There is also a couple of back end changes which you dont see but can probably find on <a href="https://github.com/darthcrios" style="color:yellow">Git Hub.</a> I have been at this for a while now just learning to code out of nowhere and now Im finding my way around multiple languages such a HTML CSS JAVA and Python. I started with learning CSound back in college 2013. Over ten years ago WOW!. I still have the bulk of my college notes. Everything music related will be found on <a href ="https://www.clovermindmusic.com" style="color: yellow;">Clovermind Music.</a> I wanted this Dialann to be more free and full of thoughts, poems etc etc. Something old school creatively, like myspace vibes but bigger but all about MISE!.<br><p><img src="../images/Duolingo_Sharing.PNG" alt="duo 100" height="200px" style="float: left;"/><em>Tá sceitimíní orm! tá an cead la seo ag foglaim le Duolingo. Is maith liom Duolingo ach ba breá liom a labhairt é. Nil aon Gaelteacht timpeall orm. Cupla Pubs í Long Beach and Brea. Ceapim as nGaeilge agus nuair beidh mé ag foghlaim Espanol, beidh mé ag smaoineamh as Gaeilge agus </em></p><br><p> <img src="../images/flippyCrios.gif" alt="crios gif" height="200px"style="float: right;"/></p><p>Its called code switching I believe, which makes sense and I do very often in my head. For so long Irish has been rattling around my head and I need to get it out, I have very few that can speak around and at home even. I dont want to <strong>Lose it</strong> so I might aswell <strong>Use it</strong> anyway I can and <em>Anois</em> its gonna be online in my lil diary. I have a bunch of posts written out and I have even tried using Google Translate to answer a few questions but I feel its a lil off in the way we speak Irish vs how we write in Irish. Spelling is also mind boggling, very diferent from english and spanish. I am kicking ass either way. My weekend was <em>go iontach!</em> LOL. Yah it was very chill went to the park and wrote some poetry. Worked on alot of NEW music which i think is pretty good. You can listen to all my demos <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chrisgrehanmusic" style="color: green;">here</a> I did live stream most days this week working on the same track. I notcied I have over 150 videos up now. My YouTube is busy!</p>
