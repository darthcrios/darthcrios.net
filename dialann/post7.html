            <p><h3>One</h3></p>
            <p>Full Moon tonight. the first full moon of 2025. Where do I start 2025? What is a good beginning? I’m not sure. I always begin the year with my birthday. Obviously that’s not gonna change but something feels a little different and I’m just trying to write it out. Maybe it’s not level of maturity or maybe it’s just because of something else. The fact that Los Angeles is like in flames right now is also super unsettling 2025 is not off to a great start so I don’t know about everybody else, but I think most folks here around me would agree well actually and follows him would be much more grateful that we’re not near the fire but you know what I mean the overall mood of despair is there.<br>January is one of those funny months that even though it’s only 31 days long, it feels kinda like two months or three months long, maybe it’s because we’re just back from the holidays, but it just feels longer. I have all my ducks in a row as they say. Bills are paid. The weekend was fun. Next check is the rent checks. That’s all done. Yeah everything‘s just lined up nicely this January thankfully financially that is, the less stress that way. What is in store for the year? </p>
